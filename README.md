üëã Welcome to My Data Science Playground

This repository is a personal sandbox where I explore, apply, and deepen my understanding of data science, machine learning, and AI through hands-on projects and experiments. Whether it‚Äôs building end-to-end apps, experimenting with foundational concepts, or applying models to real-world scenarios, this space reflects my learning journey and technical growth.

üìÅ Repository Structure

end_to_end/

Projects I‚Äôve built from scratch, including full data pipelines and functional applications. These showcase the complete lifecycle of a data product‚Äîfrom ideation and data wrangling to modeling, deployment, and visualization.

ds_concepts/

Self-contained explorations of core AI/ML concepts. This includes implementation of classic algorithms, experimentation with architectures, and tests to better understand theoretical underpinnings.

projects/

Applied machine learning projects focused on generating insights or solving domain-specific problems using real-world data. These may not include deployment, but emphasize thoughtful analysis and modeling.

Feel free to explore the folders to see what I‚Äôve been working on. Feedback, suggestions, and collaboration ideas are always welcome!
